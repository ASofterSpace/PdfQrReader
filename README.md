# PDF QR Reader

**Class:** Utility

**Language:** Java

**Platform:** Windows / Linux

A small program that reads a PDF file, finds QR codes inside of it and reads out their contents

## Setup

Download our Toolbox-Java (which is a separate project here on github) into an adjacent directory on your hard drive.

Start the build by calling under Windows:

```
build.bat
```

Or under Linux:

```
build.sh
```

## Run

Before running the PDF QR Reader, you should put the PDF file that you want to use as input into the same folder and call it `input.pdf`.

To now start up the PdfQrReader project after it has been built, you can call under Windows:

```
run.bat
```

Or under Linux:

```
run.sh
```

After running, the output will be saved to `output.txt`.
