# Krass

**Class:** A Softer Space Internal

**Language:** Java

**Platform:** Windows / Linux

This is just a quick-and-dirty default project which lies around, ready to be used, modified, and discarded again... it does not have any particular purpose.

## Setup

Download our Toolbox-Java (which is a separate project here on github) into an adjacent directory on your hard drive.

Start the build by calling under Windows:

```
build.bat
```

Or under Linux:

```
build.sh
```

## Run

To start up the Krass project after it has been built, you can call under Windows:

```
run.bat
```

Or under Linux:

```
run.sh
```
